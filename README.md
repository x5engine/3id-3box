## 3ID: Data Identity, Access Control, Encryption

3ID is a decentralized identity (DID) protocol and standard providing data identity, access control, and encryption for user data stored on the decentralized web in decentralized databases, or just IPFS.

In 3Box, wallets perform the role of holding usersâ€™ private keys, as well as using those keys for authenticating data access control, signing, and encryption via 3ID. More on 3ID below. 3Box allows users to bring their own existing wallet and relies on third-party wallet providers rather than providing a stand-alone wallet.

In order to create a 3Box session a provider needs to be passed. This can be an ethereum provider (from web3.currentProvider, or window.ethereum) or a 3ID Provider (from IdentityWallet). It is now suggested to use the 3ID Connect Provider, which is a 3ID provider that wraps available ethereum providers and will manage/permission 3ID keys, authentication and blockchain account links inside an iframe. This will become the default soon and will overide passed ethereum providers.
